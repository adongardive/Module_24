        "# From Data to Decisions: Predicting Credit Risk in Commodity Trading\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why This Matters**\n",
        "In the high-stakes world of commodity trading, every decision counts. Counterparty defaults can lead to massive financial losses, disrupted operations, and damaged reputations. The key to staying ahead? **Data-driven credit risk management.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project answers a critical question: **How can we use advanced machine learning models to predict credit risk, protect our trading operations, and ensure financial stability?**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Our Journey**\n",
        "To solve this challenge, we embarked on a structured analysis journey:\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Data**: What do our financial and exposure metrics tell us about counterparties?\n",
        "2. **Building Baseline Models**: Starting simple to learn what works—and what doesn’t.\n",
        "3. **Refining Our Approach**: Fine-tuning high-performing models to deliver actionable insights.\n",
        "4. **Driving Impact**: Translating predictions into smarter, risk-aware business decisions.\n",

        "\n",
        "To assess credit risk, we analyzed a dataset of **2029 counterparties**, enriched with:\n",
        "1. **Financial Ratios**: Metrics like Current Ratio, Debt Ratio, and Net Profit Margin that reflect financial health.\n",
        "2. **Exposure Metrics**: Indicators of how much we’re at risk with each counterparty.\n",
        "3. **Ratings**:\n",
        "   - **Internal Ratings**: Our target variable, a proprietary creditworthiness score (1–10).\n",
        "   - **External Ratings**: Credit scores from agencies like Moody’s, providing an external benchmark.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Exposure Matters**:\n",
        "   - Negative exposures (where counterparties owe us money) align with higher internal ratings, showing they’re seen as safer bets.\n",
        "   - Higher total exposures often correlate with lower ratings, highlighting potential risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Liquidity is Key**:\n",
        "   - Ratios like Current Ratio strongly correlate with creditworthiness, suggesting companies with higher liquidity are more reliable.\n",
